It is possible to interact with ICU via process communication. An external (Python) process can communicate with ICU via events and a shared memory object.

# Inter-process Communication
TODO - for now see the file `test/test_external.py` for details.

# Shared Memory
ICU exposes a shared memory object (which is implemented using process pipes), which other processes may read. The shared memory is created automatically with `process, memory = icu.start()`. The shared `memory` exposes the following attributes which can be accessed in the usual way (e.g. `memory.event_sinks`). 

* `event_sinks` - a list of event sink names, valid destinations for any events that be generated by another process.
* `event_sources` - a list of event sources, the sources of events that another process may receive from the ICU process.
* `window_properties` - a dictionary of sizes and positions of the various widgets in the windows coordinate system, as well as the window size and position in screen coordinate system.
* `config` - the ICU configuration options that were specified in the `config.json` file.

Accessing the shared memory will block until ICU has completed loading. Also note that currently this memory object is not bi-directional, its purpose is to expose various useful properties of the ICU system.
